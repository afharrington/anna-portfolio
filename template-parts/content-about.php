      <div class="subsection-text">
        <p>In the modern web, one size does not fit all, which is why many clients move away from template-based website builders as their business evolves and their site content grows in complexity.</p>
        <p>I code sites from the ground up, allowing for complete control over every element on the page. This makes for a smoother, speedier process, and means your website can seamlessly scale with your business.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-header">More than "a coder"</h3>
      <div class="subsection-text">
        <p>My heart is in web development, but my work is guided by six years of experience in marketing strategy and research. In my prior role at a marketing firm, I partnered with clients like Orbitz, Capital One, and PetSmart in gaining customer insights, refining brand positioning, and optimizing digital experiences.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-header">Always learning</h3>
      <div class="subsection-text">
        <p>I have a deep love of learning and am always expanding my repertoire of technologies, web frameworks, and design techniques. However, I strongly believe in finding the best tools for the job, not just the newest or trendiest. I work with my clients to find the options that work best for their business goals.</p>
